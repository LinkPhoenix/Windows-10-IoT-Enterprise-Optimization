# Description
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise optimization is a repository that references documentation on this version of Windows as well as Scripts to be able to customize your master image for industrial use

# Why I created this repositorie?
In my activity I had to create a new Master image with Windows 10 IoT Enterprise LTSB 2016, but we do not have any tools for creating and deploying Microsoft.

For partners who were remote, me and my team had to restart the whole process of customizing Windows, so I decided to script the process.

# What is Windows 10 IoT Enterprise?
Windows 10 IoT Enterprise is a full version of Windows 10 that delivers enterprise manageability and security to IoT solutions. Windows 10 IoT Enterprise shares all the benefits of the worldwide Windows ecosystem. It is a binary equivalent to Windows 10 Enterprise, so you can use the same familiar development and management tools as client PCs and laptops. However, when it comes to licensing and distribution, the desktop version and IoT versions differ.
